#### Search for Windows that doesn't suck

Currently under active development. Many, many issues are being ironed out.

Requires the non-lite version of [Everything 64-bit](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) for search indexing.

Controls:

- ESC to close results window.

- CTRL + WIN + Period (full-stop) to focus the searchbar above other windows, otherwise it lives on your desktop.

  - The keybind can be changed by right-clicking the searchbar, but custom keybinds are not saved between restarts at this time.

- Double-click to open files.
