# Illumine

#### Search for Windows that doesn't suck

Currently under active development. Many, many issues are being ironed out.

The current beta [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/luketimothyjones/Illumine/releases/download/v0.0.6-beta/Illumine.Setup.exe).

---

Controls:

- ESC to close results window.

- CTRL + WIN + Period (full-stop) to focus the searchbar above other windows, otherwise it lives on your desktop.

  - The keybind can be changed by right-clicking the searchbar.

- Double-click to open files.

---

NOTE:  

Illumine requires the non-lite version of [Everything 64-bit](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) for search indexing. If it is not already installed, the setup will install it for you.
